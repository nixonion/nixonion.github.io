title: Cyber Security Interview Questions

During my job interviewing days, I started creating a question bank of cybersecurity interview questions. After each interview, I would add another question to the list. My question bank is stored on GitHub, and I am planning to make it publicly available soon. My goal is to compile all the questions and answers and display them on a website, organized by different topics, so that students and interviewers can easily find relevant questions. I also want to turn this into a crowdsourced project, allowing others to contribute their own questions and insights. If anyone has ideas on how to effectively crowdsource this project, I would greatly appreciate the help.
