Hey there, 

I'm Nabeel Sayed, your friendly neighborhood security engineer and I am doing my best to keep things safe and sound in the digital realm. I started out as a penetration tester, but these days, I'm focused on securing services and devices ensuring everything runs securely (Secure is the keyword here). I've picked up a few tricks along the way—like web app pen testing, encryption, threat modeling, and device security—but I'm always learning more. Outside of work, I enjoy juggling clubs and balls (not always successfully!) and tinkering with my harmonica playing horrible tunes. 
Oh, and if you haven't read "Animal Farm" yet, consider this your gentle nudge—it's a must-read, trust me.

### [](#header-3)Why nixonion?

Nixonion used to be my gamer ID, and I ended up using it everywhere. I guess it’s one of those cringe IDs we create when we’re younger, but I don’t see a reason to stop using it. The name came about when I was seven, playing some game, and I used a random name generator for my custom player. It popped out "nixonion," and I chose to stick with it. Despite its origins and the slightly embarrassing nature of the name, it's become a part of my online identity, and I’ve grown attached to it over the years.
